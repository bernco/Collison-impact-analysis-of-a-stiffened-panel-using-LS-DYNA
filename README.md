# Collison-impact-analysis-of-a-stiffened-panel-using-LS-DYNA
This LS-DYNA non-linear finite element structural analysis involves a stiffened panel with an impacting object which is non-smooth in order to induce a state of shear and stress.

The indenter is the impacting body while the plate is the impacted body 
The deformation and kinetic energy of the thhe system can be analysed as well as the contact forces.

Dynamic impact analysis which can be highly influenced by strain rate effect should be carefully analysed in order to obtain realistic results.

For running the NLFE code, all keyword files (.k) should be in the same folder.
The simulation file should be the imput file for running the analysis.
